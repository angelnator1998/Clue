Digital Clue detective notes

I coded this digital version of the Clue detective notes in one night
that I was particularly bored. Hopefully one day when I advance my 
coding knowledge of databases and javascript I'll update this to be 
a full fledged game. (Feel to grab my code and mod it or make the game on your own)

For now just enjoy this simple digital detective notes. No one will ever be 
able to peak at your notes again.

I'm uploading all of my code with a few comments on them (I tried my best)

If you would like to take advantage to these digital detective notes please go to
